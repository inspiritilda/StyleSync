### 6. Your minimum viable product (MVP)

To find MVP:

-   Identify Core Features: Determine the essential features necessary for the product to function.

-   Prioritize Features: Focus on features critical to the core user experience.

-   Define Scope: Establish the minimum set of features for a usable product, avoiding feature creep.

-   Set Goals: Establish clear objectives for the MVP, such as validating product-market fit.

-   Create Prototypes: Develop prototypes to visualize and gather feedback on the MVP.

-   Iterate and Refine: Build, release, and iterate on the MVP based on user feedback.

-   Launch and Learn: Launch the MVP, gather user data, and make informed decisions for future development.

-   Iterate and Expand: Continuously improve and expand the product based on user needs and insights.
