## Project Information

**_Topic_**:
- Development of Personal Fashion App (Personal Closet)

**_Problem_**:

- There is a lot of waste in the current Fashion Industry, this leads to personal closets being too full of clothing. We are unable to keep track clothing in the closet and difficult to mix-and-match clothing without physically trying on the clothing pieces.

**_Solution_**:

- Personal Fashion Tracking App, takes in closet items and allows virtual try on of clothing.
